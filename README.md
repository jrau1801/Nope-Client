<!-- Knockout Card Game - Semester Project -->
### Nope Card Game - Semester Project
### Introduction
Welcome to our semester project on the Nope Card Game! In this project, we explore the exciting and entertaining world of card games, focusing specifically on the rules and mechanics of the Nope Card Game. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the game, its components, setup, gameplay, and objectives.

### Components
To begin, let's explore the components of the Nope Card Game. The game comprises a total of 104 cards, each serving a unique purpose. These cards include:

- 4 Joker cards
- 14 Action cards
- 4 Restart cards
- 4 Insight cards
- 6 Choice cards
- 66 Two-color cards (24 cards with numbers 1, 2, and 3 in each color combination)
- 20 Solid color cards (8 cards with numbers 1 and 2, and 4 cards with the number 3 in Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow)

### Objective
In the Nope Card Game, your objective is simple: be the last player standing with cards in hand. It requires strategy, cunning, and a bit of luck to outmaneuver your opponents and secure victory. Keep your wits about you and eliminate your opponents one card at a time.

<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started

<!-- Prerequisites -->
### Prerequisites

This project uses the SocketIO-Client package

```bash
 pip install "python-socketio[client]"
```

## Usage



<!-- Screenshots -->
### Screenshots

```
To run the game by yourself you'll probably have to change some settings.
In IntelliJ IDEA this is necessary.
```
```
-> Run -> Edit Configurations -> Allow Multiple instances
```


<div align="center"> 
  <img src="assets/settings.png" alt="screenshot" />
</div>

```
Run main.py two times and split them Left/Right for better usage
```

### Documentation
```
As mentioned before, this project has been documented with Sphinx.
The landing page looks like this:
```
<div align="center"> 
  <img src="assets/sphinxdoc.png" alt="screenshot" />
</div>

```
Every method and class has been documented.
This is the place to go if you want to understand the code better.
```

```
To run Sphinx you'll need the following command.
And changes to conf.py are needed sometimes, when working with different directories
Here we added syspaths for the directories we are workning in.
```

<div align="center"> 
  <img src="assets/conf.png" alt="screenshot" />
</div>

```bash
sphinx-build -b html . build
```
```
"html" is the format, "." is the source dir and "build" is the target dir
```
